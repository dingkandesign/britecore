# BriteCore

Hello,

This repository holds my submission for BriteCore's DesignProject-B. 

# Process
I have a number of sketches and notes that I took during the initial phase of discovery and brainstorming. I will transcribe them here to cover for my handwriting.

Target: insurance carriers seekign an intuitive portal to manage agents/agencies across state lines, keeping track of licenses and lines of business.

Schedule: 
Day 1 - outline necessary deliverables, esp. user needs; discovery phase
Day 2 - sketch each use case, look for overlap/link
Day 3 - information architecture to connect use cases; early proto for design elements
Day 4 - hi-fi prototype; user testing
Day 5 - refine; user test
Day 6 - code, debug
Day 7 - refine; submit

Deliverables: HTML/CSS proto (static, one page). Others = hifi proto. Design process.

early non-precious idea: clickable map for assigning agency states, further radial/multi-check box for licenses or lines of business in each state. covers two use cases at once. 

But each agent will have their own licenses. How does that work, it not being directly correlated to agency line of biz? //Emailed Will, got an answer.
I guess the don't have to use it, necessarily, but that it is good to have on file.

Maybe a feature allowing carriers to see these discrepancies between the two (agents/agencies with mismatched license overlap). Could find better fits, or suggest how to best optimize agents to agencies.

Who decides if an agency can operate a line of business? Critical mass of agent/agency licenses? Market?

Analytics/Insight idea:
Larger dashboard that uses information design to highlight growth opportunities in the existing workforce. So listing out lines of business that are as of yet unapproved but have agencies w/agents that have the applicable licenses. Or maybe a caution/warning that the carrier has too many agencies doing the same line of business in the same area/state. Oversaturation.

#Protoype
Further, I prototyped the submission in Adobe XD CC. I have uploaded the XD file to this repo, as well as included a live prototype linked here:
